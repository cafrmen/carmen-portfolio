                        Granulation is a process in which an audio sample is divided into small audio
                        segments. Created by Fabian Campuzano within Max/MSP, based on the C programming language.
                        Max is named after synthesis pioneer Max Mathews, who first demonstrated music
                        synthesis on a digital computer in 1957. It was exported to a JSON file and
                        it was finally designed with JS and CSS.

                        doesn't offer real security but it's interesting to know how everything

    We all know that there are libraries to run a calculator and that we
    even have the eval() function in JS, but why do something so boring,
    it is better to use your own logic. This calculator was created exactly
    like this, with pure logic and Vanilla JS, without libraries and with
    its own functions. Do you want to see how well it works? So: Try
    breaking this calculator!
